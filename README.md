# Bootstrap Remix Project


## Overview
This project remixes Bootstrap components into a small 3-page website:
- **index.html** – Homepage with navbar, hero, features, footer
- **about.html** – About page with mission/vision/values cards
- **contact.html** – Contact page with a working Netlify form


## How It Was Built
1. Added Bootstrap via CDN.
2. Chose components (navbar, hero, cards, forms) from [Bootstrap Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/).
3. Remixed and styled them into 3 pages.
4. Deployed using GitHub + Netlify.


## Where I Got Help
- Bootstrap official docs & examples
- Netlify forms documentation


## Challenges & Solutions
- **Form not working locally:** Works only after deployment to Netlify → solved by adding `data-netlify="true"` and deploying.

- **Spacing issues:** Solved with Bootstrap utility classes (`py-5`, `g-4`).
